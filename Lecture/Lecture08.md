# Python Introduction
## Overview
- [History](#brief-history-of-python)
- Significance
- Installing & Running Python
- Sumple script examples


## Languages
- Some influential ones:
    - FORTRAN
        - Science / engineering
    - COBOL
        - business data
    - LISP
        - logic and AI
    - BASIC
        - a simple language

## Programming basics
- Code or source code: The sequence of instructions in a program
- Syntax: the set of legal structures and commands that can be used in a particular programming language
- Output: The messages printed to the user by a program
- Console: The text box onto which output is printed

## Compiling and Interpreting
- Many languages require you to compile (translate) your program into a form that the machine understands
- Python is instead directly interpreted into machine instructions

## Brief History of Python
- Invented in the Netherlands, early 90s by Guido van Rossum
- Named after Monty Python (British surreal comedy troupe)
- Open sourced from the beginning, man-aged by Python Software Foundation
- Considered a scripting lanugage, but is much more
- Scalable, object oriented and functional from the beginning
- Used by Google from the beginning

### Programming Paradigm
- Python
    - Procedural
    - Object Oriented
    - Functional
    - (no logic (Prolog))

### Python's Benevolent Dictator for Life
"Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another's code; too little and expressive-ness is endangered."
- Guido van Rossum

### Python's place in the Market
- TIOBE has been collecting data on programming language "popularity" for many years
- Counts results for a query like "\<language> programming" popular search engines
